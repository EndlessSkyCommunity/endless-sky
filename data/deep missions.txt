# Given the current skeleton, the following would need to be done in order to unlock the Bactrian:
#	10 mystery cube jobs
#	3 transport scientist jobs
#	3 escort science vessel jobs
#	3 record academic conference jobs
#	2 convoy missions
#	The current TMBR string + the 3 missions added by this
#	The Deep: Mystery Cubes string added by this
#	The Deep Archaeology string
#	The Deep: Singularity string added by this
#	The Deep: Remnant string added by this
#	The Remnant intro missions (kind of optional, as the player may choose to plunder Remnant tech, but this would ruin future storylines for the player; do you really want the Bactrian that much?)
#	The Deep: Star Queen Rescue string added by this

# What exactly could they be? 
# Why would you be burying them in random places, giving them to beggars, leaving them in abandoned towers, and leaving them by the sides of roads? These seem like very scattered locations. 
# Presumably they are retrieved, as otherwise they'd start to pile up as more merchants took those types of jobs. 
# And why would bounty hunters chase the player for these cubes?

# Lore about the mysterious cubes:
# The cubes are some sort of recording or sensor device; strikingly similar to the devices given to the player during Alpha Surveillance. (Actually called micro-sats.)
# What could the be recording? Fleet movements. Anomalies. Cloaked ships?
# Most likely tracking at the very least fleet movements, allowing the Deep Security to know where pirates are. This is why bounty hunters attempt to destroy ships transporting these cubes. 
# The cubes likely record far more than just fleet movements, but this is what the player is told.
# Deep: Mystery Cubes missions will involve first

			`The remaining fleet quickly enters the atmosphere of Haven and begins scanning the surface. After about an hour of flying, you receive a transmission that the Star Queen has been found, along with its coordinates.`
			`	You watch from afar as the Mule lands outside a hangar in some sort of pirate facility. The Mule immediately unloads what looks to be at least four dozen armed soldiers who quickly surround and breach the hangar. After about ten minutes, the hangar doors slide open to reveal the Star Queen, still intact. You hear chatter over the radio saying that most of the crew and scientists are still inside.`
			`	"Good job, everyone," you hear Lieutenant Paris say over the comms. "Now we just need to make it back to <destination> in one piece." Just as he says that and the Star Queen and Mule begin activating their repulsor engines, a heavy laser beam pierces the sky, slicing the Mule in half while its shields are down. Soldiers begin scrambling into the Star Queen, which quickly takes off into space along with the rest of the fleet. You turn your repulsor engines to full and begin flying up into space behind them.`
