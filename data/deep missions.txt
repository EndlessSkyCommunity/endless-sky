"We've checked each of your records, and it would appear that you are all clear of any crimes that would connect you to public enemy number one, 'Beelzebub.'

			`	"Allow me to explain the situation. Roughly two weeks after the last of the sensor cubes that you ladies and gentlemen placed were in position, we spotted Beelzebub's ship in the northern region of the Dirt Belt. Navy ships from the nearest base were dispatched to apprehend the vessel, which turned out to be nothing more than a decoy." While previously the admiral was speaking calmly, he begins to raise his voice. "That very same day, with a number of our ships off-world, a pirate fleet managed to assault the base and capture a handful of docked Cruisers, while simultaneously disabling many of the cubes across the Dirt Belt and Core."`
			`	Paris begins to fill in the rest of the story. "The cubes that Deep Security had you position on multiple worlds were surveillance devices - sensor cubes, as we call them - designed to track Beelzebub's ship and notify us when the ship was located. It can be presumed that Beelzebub now has access to these cubes and has undoubtedly converted them to work in their favor. It may take us weeks to retrieve them, but at the moment it can be assumed that Beelzebub knows where we will be."`

				`	"Are we part of a plan to take Beelzebub down?"`
			
			`	"Beelzebub is perhaps the most wanted warlord by the Republic since the 28th century. With both Navy and Deep technology now in the hands of this criminal, every available ship will be required to take him down. The primary purpose for bringing you all here was to determine if any of you were connected to Beelzebub, possibly leading to him being able to locate the cubes, but seeing as how you are all in the clear we are now hoping that you would be willing to assist us in trapping Beelzebub. The six of your fleets combined would certainly make up for anything that the Navy has lost in the attack."`
			`	"How much will we be paid?" one of the other merchant captains asks. "At minimum, 1,000,000 credits," the admiral replies. The captain who asked instantly agrees to help, quickly followed by two others.`

				`	"Sorry, but I am not interested in helping."`
			
			`	Only one of the other merchant captains declines as well. You are both escorted out of the room, and as you leave the admiral begins to explain to the other four captains how they will be helping.`
			`	The trip back up the elevator is silent until the doors open and a flood of conversations hits you as you step back out into the spaceport.`
				decline
			
			label accept
			`	In the end, only one of the merchant captains declines. She is escorted out of the room as the admiral begins to explain how each merchant captain will be helping.`
			`	"We assume that Beelzebub knows where we will be, but we know where he is as well. The stolen Cruisers and the remaining pirate fleet that attacked our base moved toward the Core. Given the heinous crime that Beelzebub has just committed, he will undoubtedly be attempting to get as far away from the law as possible. That leaves us only two possible places that Beelzebub will go: Buccaner Bay or the anarchist colonies of the Far North, the latter of which being far more appealing for a warlord.`
			`	The admiral goes on to explain how multiple blockades will be set up across the galaxy in an attempt to either capture Beelzebub or box him in. At the same time, any spare Navy and Deep Security fleets will be scanning the galaxy from the Dirt Belt toward the Paradise Worlds and the Core in an attempt to weed the warlord out of hiding and toward the blockades.`

			`When you return to Valhalla, the Star Queen is no longer on the landing pad and the spaceport seems to be running normally. Shortly after landing, you find Lieutenant Paris at the same restaurant in which he first found you. Before saying a word to you, he hands you a license.`

			`	You look down at the license that Paris just handed you and notice that it's a city-ship license, one that will allow you to purchase the Bactrian. "I think it's only fair that you be able to purchase one after having to fight one to the death. It's really the least I could do for you."`

			`As you land near the Star Queen, you can see the passengers of the ship being escorted off of it. A medical team is examining each passenger while a Deep Security officer asks them questions and jots down the responses. Sadly, you also notice a number of body bags next to the ship, likely from scientists or crew that were found dead on the ship.`
			`	Lieutenant Paris is waiting for you outside of your ship, and hands you another 100,000 credits when you walk up to him.`
			`	"Thanks for all the help, Captain <last>. We couldn't have done it without you."`
			`	Paris looks back to the Star Queen, and you can overhear talk on the status of the passengers and crew. "Sarah, Nicole, Abby..." the list of names goes on for about two dozen more, most of which sound female. "...and Benjamin are all either missing or were found dead on board. The surviving crew tells us that only a few were killed initially, either during boarding or by being thrown out the airlock on the way to Haven. Most of the others were either killed or dragged off after they had reached their destination at a facility of some sort, its purpose unidentifiable to the crew."`
			`	The entire time you noticed Paris holding back tears, his face becoming more and more strained with each passing name. After they are done listing the dead or missing, he turns to you and hands you a license.`
			`	"Thank you. I've said it before, but there's really no way I can thank you enough."`
