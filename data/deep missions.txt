			`	Upon landing, you are escorted by pair of men in Navy uniforms past the tourist areas of the moon facility and into the back to an elevator. One of your escorts uses a keycard to open the elevator, ushering you in. The elevator opens up many floors below the spaceport, to an area of the facility that looks far newer than that on the surface.`
			`	You are kept in what looks like a waiting room along with five others. After a bit of talking, you find out that these are the other merchant captains who helped place the cubes across different regions of known space.`
			`	An hour of waiting passes, and Lieutenant Paris walks into the room followed by a Navy admiral. "I hope you are all enjoying your stay," the admiral remarks. "Now. How is it that most of the cubes you placed were mysteriously disabled shortly after pirates entered the systems?"`

			`	He continues, "Allow me to explain the situation. Roughly two weeks after the last of your 'deliveries' were activated, the sensors identified Beelzebub's ship in the northern reaches of the Dirt Belt. We dispatched half of the nearest Navy garrison to apprehend the vessel, only to arrive and find a convoy of Star Barges instead."`
			`	"Worse, while our ships were in pursuit of the decoys, a pirate fleet managed to assault their home base and captured a handful of docked Cruisers. And, amidst the chaos, most of the cubes you placed in the Dirt Belt and Core were disabled!"`
			`	Before the admiral can work himself up further, Paris intercedes with the rest of the story. "The cubes that Deep Security had you position on multiple worlds were surveillance devices - sensor cubes, as we call them - designed to track Beelzebub's ship and notify us when the ship was located. It can be presumed that Beelzebub now has access to these cubes and has undoubtedly converted them to work in his favor. It may take us weeks to retrieve them, but at the moment it can be assumed that Beelzebub knows where we will be."`
			choice
				`	"Why are you involving us in this?"`
				`	"Are we part of a plan to take Beelzebub down?"`
			
			`	"Beelzebub is perhaps the most wanted warlord by the Republic since the 28th century. With both Navy and Deep technology now in the hands of this criminal, every available ship will be required to take him down. Given this, we are now hoping that you would be willing to assist us in trapping Beelzebub. The six of your fleets combined would certainly make up for anything that the Navy has lost in the attack."`
			`	"How much will we be paid?" one of the other merchant captains asks. "At minimum, one million credits," the admiral replies. The captain who asked instantly agrees to help, as do two others.`

			label accept
			`	In the end, only one of the merchant captains declines. She is escorted out of the room, and the admiral explains each merchant captain's new role.`
			`	"We assume that Beelzebub knows where we will be, but we know where he is as well - the stolen Cruisers and the pirate fleet that attacked our base moved toward the Core. Given the severity of the crime that Beelzebub has just committed, he will undoubtedly attempt to get as far away from the law as possible. That leaves us only two possible destinations: Buccaneer Bay, or the anarchist colonies of the Far North. Our best guess is that the colonies are the more appealing option for a warlord."`
			`	"We'll be setting up multiple blockades around the galaxy in hopes of boxing Beelzebub in as we sweep the galaxy. Captain <last>, you will be stationed on <destination> with Lieutenant Paris and a small Navy fleet. Please gather your things and travel there immediately."`

			`As you land near the Star Queen, you can see the passengers of the ship being escorted off of it. Maria and Hannah come running off the ship in tears over to Garrison, who must have arrived as soon as he heard the news. A medical team is examining each passenger while a Deep Security officer asks questions and jots down the responses. Sadly, you also notice a number of body bags next to the ship, likely from scientists or crew that were found dead on the ship.`

			`	Paris looks back to the Star Queen, and you can overhear one of the Deep Security officers listing off names. "Sarah Reevs, Nicole Faye, Issac Joules, Laura Paris..." the list goes on for slightly over a dozen total names. "The surviving crew tells us that only a few were killed initially, either during boarding or by being thrown out the airlock on the way to Haven. Most of the others were either killed or dragged off after they had reached their destination at a facility of some sort, its purpose unidentifiable to the crew."`
			`	When you look back to Lieuntenant Paris, you notice that he is holding back tears. Laura Paris was one of the scientists who died...`
			`	He talks to you in a rather strained voice. "I want you to return to Arneb and take out every single one of those pirates that are left. Especially the Bactrian. We try to keep Bactrians out of unworthy hands, so whenever a pirate gets ahold of one we make sure we destroy it immediately. Seeing as how we're going to be busy here for a while, you need to be the one who destroys it."`

			`When you return to Valhalla, the Star Queen is no longer on the landing pad and the spaceport seems to be running normally. Shortly after landing, you find Lieutenant Paris at the same restaurant in which he first found you. Before saying a word to you, he hands you a license.`
			`	"Thank you. I've said it before, but there's really no way I can thank you enough."`
			`	You look down at the license that Paris just handed you and notice that it's a city-ship license, one that will allow you to purchase the Bactrian. "I think it's only fair that you be able to purchase one after having to fight one to the death, and the government of the Deep agrees. It's really the least I, and we, could do for you."`
