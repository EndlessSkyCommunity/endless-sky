#
#	Deep "end:"
#		The Deep: Scientist Rescue string added by this
#
#	To Do:
#		Write Deep: Mystery Cubes

# Lore about the mysterious cubes:
# These cubes, called sensor cubes, are used by the Deep to track fleet movements above the planet which they are placed on, most importantly the movements of pirate fleets.
# The Deep uses merchants to place the cubes to try and make them more inconspicuous
# Information gathered from these cubes is used by Deep Security and is on rare occasions handed over to the Republic or Navy (DS is an independent police force and therefore is under no jurisdiction to have to hand over all its info to the Navy).
# For some reason, pirates know of this and send bounty hunters after anyone they know are in possesion of these cubes, stealing them before destroying the merchant.
# Cubes are asked to be retrieved by merchants for reasons unknown; malfunctions? just old sensors? One can only wonder.

# Deep: Mystery Cubes missions will involve first... I have no idea.
# I'm thinking about having one of the missions involve going to Carbuncle Station
# Maybe something to do with assisting Deep Security in tracking down a warlord (DS would still be low on ships during this time for whatever reason)
# Might have to get the Navy involved

# The player gets called into somewhere and is asked about their work for Albert. They get questioned on what Albert told them, and seeing as how the player has been helping the Deep lately, the Deep tell the player some of their folklore.
# "Over the centuries the exact date of when the Deep was established have been lost, but folklore says that the first humans arrived here in the mid 1300s before the time of the Black Death."
# Not sure what these missions would entail. Would likely involve some of the scientists from Deep: TMBR, since they left to work on Midgard, where the singularity is. Also want to involve Lt. Paris in some way, who will be first introduced in Deep: Mystery Cubes

The Mule immediately unloads what looks to be at least four dozen armed soldiers who quickly surround and breach the hangar. After about ten minutes, the hangar doors slide open to reveal the Star Queen, still intact. You hear chatter over the radio saying that most of the crew and scientists are still inside.`
			`	"Good job, everyone," you hear Lieutenant Paris say over the comms. "Now we just need to make it back to <destination> in one piece." Just as he says that and the Star Queen and Mule begin activating their repulsor engines, a heavy laser beam pierces the sky, slicing the Mule in half while its shields are down. Soldiers begin scrambling into the Star Queen, which quickly takes off into space along with the rest of the fleet. You turn your repulsor engines to full and begin flying up into space behind them.`
