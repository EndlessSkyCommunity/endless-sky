# Given the current skeleton, the following would need to be done in order to unlock the Bactrian:
#
#	Deep "intro:"
#		10 mystery cube jobs
#		3 transport scientist jobs
#		3 escort science vessel jobs
#		3 record academic conference jobs
#
#	Deep "start:"
#		At least one of three convoy missions added by this
#		The current TMBR string + the 3 missions added by this 
#			(optional if the player instead does all three of the convoy missions)
#		The Deep: Mystery Cubes string added by this
#
#	Deep "middle:"
#		The Deep Archaeology string
#		The Deep: Singularity string added by this
#		The Deep: Remnant string added by this (second half of the string is optional)
#		Discover the Remnant (and finish their intro missions to complete the rest of the Deep: Remnant string, or attack the Remnant to plunder their outfits instead)
#
#	Deep "end:"
#		The Deep: Scientist Rescue string added by this
#
#	To Do:
#		Write Deep: Mystery Cubes
#		Write Deep: Singularity
#		Rewrite Deep: Scientist Rescue to account for the player's previous actions assisting the Deep and to account for the new characters that the player will now know which are involved in the situation.
#		Add logs where necessary

# What exactly could they be? 
# Why would you be burying them in random places, giving them to beggars, leaving them in abandoned towers, and leaving them by the sides of roads? These seem like very scattered locations. 
# Presumably they are retrieved, as otherwise they'd start to pile up as more merchants took those types of jobs. 
# And why would bounty hunters chase the player for these cubes?

# Lore about the mysterious cubes:
# The cubes are some sort of recording or sensor device; strikingly similar to the devices given to the player during Alpha Surveillance. (Actually called micro-sats.)
# What could the be recording? Fleet movements. Anomalies. Cloaked ships?
# Most likely tracking at the very least fleet movements, allowing the Deep Security to know where pirates are. This is why bounty hunters attempt to destroy ships transporting these cubes. 
# The cubes likely record far more than just fleet movements, but this is what the player is told.
# Deep: Mystery Cubes missions will involve first... I have no idea.
# I'm thinking about having one of the missions involve going to Carbuncle Station

After they are done listing the dead or missing, he talks to you in a rather strained voice. "I want you to return to Arneb and take out every single one of those pirates that are left. Especially the Bactrian. We try to keep Bactrians out of unworthy hands, so whenever a pirate gets ahold of one we make sure we destroy it immediately. Seeing as how we're going to be busy here for a while, you need to destroy it."`

			`When you return to Valhalla, the Star Queen is no longer on the landing pad and the spaceport seems to be running normally. Shortly after landing, you find Lieutenant Paris at the same restaurant in which he first found you. Before saying a word to you, he hands you a license.`

			`	You look down at the license that Paris just handed you and notice that it's a city-ship license, one that will allow you to purchase the Bactrian. "I think it's only fair that you be able to purchase one after having to fight one to the death. It's really the least I could do for you."`

			`As you land near the Star Queen, you can see the passengers of the ship being escorted off of it. A medical team is examining each passenger while a Deep Security officer asks them questions and jots down the responses. Sadly, you also notice a number of body bags next to the ship, likely from scientists or crew that were found dead on the ship.`
